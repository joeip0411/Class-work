Pardon my lord I will not show my,lord
Well show thee Io as she was a,man
In my just censure in my true,lovers
Welcome him then according to his,own
Come quench your blushes and present,itself
Have by some surgeon Shylock on your,own
Queen Hecuba and,so
Your honour and your goodness is so,much
What a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the,word
It is may it be,so
Whose salt imagination yet hath,wrongd
Thou art welcome,makes
My liege your highness now may do me,for
That whoso askd her for his,wife
The party gainst the which he doth,call
But who comes here I am,sure
Will serve the,world
Ist so,much
As doth thy face through tears of mine give,up
I have some private schooling for you,are
